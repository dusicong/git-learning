Hello, this is the first commit.

(delete 2nd commit)

Here is 3rd commit.

0320

Theme: use "git rebase -i" "git cherry-pick"to arrange commits

an example for a process.

1. open the door
2. put down the bag
3. something wrong01
4. take off the coat
5. something wrong02
6. lay down on bed
7. have a little rest after work

(when I tried to delete 3. and 5., conflict happened. 

While "git cherry-pick" & "git rebase -i" can arrange modifications, this time modification are in the same file, so conflict happened and I have to use "git rebase --abort" )
